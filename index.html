Mobile network traffic engineering requires benchmark traffic data. This paper shared a set of labeled mobile traffic data based on our presented mobilegt. The mobile traffic were generated by volunteers’ mobile devices on which mobilegt runs. The mobile traffic can be labeled in 100% accuracy based on the TCP/UDP session information of each traffic flow collected by mobilegt. On the mobile traffic, we found that 1) most of traffic utilize http as application protocol, and these traffic are generally label as web by traditional traffic label method; 2) social and web traffic account a large amount of flows as popular usages of social and web apps; 3) when performing several machine learning techniques on the mobile traffic data, random forest performs the best among.

Based on the mobilegt, we collected the traffic generated by mobile apps on monitored smart phones. The collected mobile traffic data include active MTD (AMTD) and passive MTD(PMTD). 
<ul>
	<li>AMTD</li>
	The AMTD were collected through deploying the mgtClient on 10 volunteers’ smart phones and the mgtServer on a remote server during October, 2016 to March, 2017. Volunteers launched mgtClient when they would like to share their data. During data collection, they used popular apps as usual, such asWeChat,Weibo etc. As a whole, the dataset is made up of 4050 traffic traces,and per trace covers about 16mins on average.
	<li>PMDT</li>
	The PMDT were collected during May 7 to May 24, 2018 by deploying mgtClient on a smart phone.We installed the apps shown in Table 1 on the smart phone, launch these apps. And then, we start the mgtClient to collect the session information and the mgtServer to collect the raw traffic data. And then, we would not use the
smart phone. These apps were run in background, so as to collect the passive traffic data. As a whole, the dataset is made up of 677 traffic traces, and per trace covers about 27mins on average. We finally got 9617 passive flows. These flows could be combined with above active flows to evalaute the performance of methods on
identifying passive traffic.
</ul>
The characteristics of shared data are as following. 1) The traffic are grouped into flows and popular flow statistical features are extracted from raw traffic, and the data could be directly used to evaluate the performance of machine learning techniques on classifying multiple apps. 2) Passive traffic data (background traffic) were separately collected for passive and active (foreground traffic) traffic classification research.
