    project introduction
Mobile network traffic engineering requires benchmark traffic data. This paper shared a set of labeled mobile traffic data based on our presented mobilegt. The mobile traffic were generated by volunteersâ€™ mobile devices on which mobilegt runs. The mobile traffic can be labeled in 100% accuracy based on the TCP/UDP session information of each traffic flow collected by mobilegt. On the mobile traffic, we found that 1) most of traffic utilize http as application protocol, and these traffic are generally label as web by traditional traffic label method; 2) social and web traffic account a large amount of flows as popular usages of social and web apps; 3) when performing several machine learning techniques on the mobile traffic data, random forest performs the best among.
